This is a website for a company my group has made.
For Educational Use Only.

##For Group Members
So basically every layout is roughly very similar without content, your goal is just to 

*add content under <!-- Enter your content here â†“-->* 

*Want to use a stylesheet?*
uncomment <!-- <link href="location to your css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"> -->  in head by removing  <!-- --> and add the location of your external stylesheet in href.
