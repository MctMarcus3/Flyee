This is a website for a company my group has made.
For Educational Use Only.

## For Group Members
So basically every layout is roughly very similar without content, your goal is just to 

*add content under &lt;!-- Enter your content here ↓--&gt;* 

*Want to use a stylesheet?*
uncomment &lt;!-- &lt;link href="location to your css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; --&gt;  in head by removing  &lt;!-- --&gt; and add the location of your external stylesheet in href.
